Concept What is Grid Search
Grid Search is a hyperparameter tuning method where a model is trained and evaluated using every possible combination of a predefined set of hyperparameter values. The goal is to find the best hyperparameter combination that maximizes model performance.
In essence, it systematically searches through a grid (matrix) of hyperparameters, training and testing a model for each combination, then selects the best one based on cross-validation performance.
For example, if you're tuning an SVM model and want to find the best values for C and kernel, Grid Search will try every possible combination of those hyperparameters and report the best one.

Pros and Cons of Grid Search
Pros

Comprehensive It tests every possible combination of hyperparameters within the specified grid, so you’re guaranteed to find the best configuration from that grid.
Simple to understand and implement Grid Search is conceptually straightforward, making it easy to set up and apply to different models.
Cons

Computationally Expensive As the number of hyperparameters increases, the search space grows exponentially. If you have many hyperparameters or large datasets, this method can become extremely time-consuming.
Inefficient for Large Spaces Often, many combinations don’t improve performance. Random Search or more advanced techniques can be more efficient for large hyperparameter spaces.
